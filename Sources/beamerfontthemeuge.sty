%% Note on the UGE graphical charter.
%% The UGE recommends to use TTNorm which is a non-free font and thus unusable by almost all agents.
%% Furthermore, this font is not well suited for mathematical expressions and symbols...
%% --
%% Regarding the Tahoma equivalent recommendation:
%%   - Tahoma was made for on-screen reading
%%   - Tahoma is worst than TTNorm for the mathematical expressions.
%% 
%%   As a consequence, I recommend to use the Inria Fonts, FREELY available
%% at https://black-foundry.com/blog/inria-serif-and-inria/ and under an Open Font Licence.
