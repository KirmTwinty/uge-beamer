* UGE-beamer theme
** Introduction
The purpose of this beamer theme is to provide a beamer template for presentation for Université Gustave Eiffel.
The presentation is tested and must be compiled with =XeTeX=.

** Installation
To use the theme, download the =.sty= files and the =img= folder by the method of your choice (download the archive directly or using =git clone=).

You can also try the theme by compiling the provided =test.tex= file. The file provides details on how to use the theme in comments.

** Usage
*** Authors and affiliation
Authors are added successively to make it easier to read, with the following syntax: 
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\author[mail address (optional)]{Author Name}{Affiliation index}
#+END_SRC
Then, the affiliation are also added recursively: 
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\affil[affiliation number]{Name of affiliation}
#+END_SRC

*** Thanks-frame
You can add a "thank-you" frame by using the =\thanksframe= command. By default, the title page template is taken with the title, subtitle, your "thank-you" message, conference name and date. 
For instance:
#+BEGIN_SRC: latex
\thanksframe{{\huge\textbf{Thank you!}}}
#+END_SRC


*** Fonts
UGE's graphical guidelines ask to use =TT Norms®=. However those fonts appear to be non-free and not well adapted for equations.
Therefore, the guidelines recommend to use =Tahoma= when =TT Norms®= is not available. However, =Tahoma= was made for on-screen reading and is even worst than =TT Norms®= for equations. 
As a consequence, by default, the beamer theme uses =Tahoma= for text and =Computer Modern Serif= for maths equation, used by LaTeX by defaults.

*** Inria Fonts (optional)
Another way though is to use the [[https://black-foundry.com/blog/inria-serif-and-inria][Inria]] fonts, under an =Open Font License=. 
**** _Method 1:_ download and install the fonts on your machine
Download the fonts and install them on your machine (usually, you just have to open the =.ttf= fonts files). Then, use the option =inriafonts= in the theme: 
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\usetheme[inriafonts]{uge} % Use Inria fonts, make sure to have the ttf files in the same directory.
#+END_SRC 
**** _Method 2:_ no font install
Download the fonts and place the files =InriaSans-Regular.ttf= and =InriaSerif-Regular.ttf= in the same directory than the =.sty= files and your main =.tex= file. Then, use the option =inriafonts= in the theme: 
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\usetheme[inriafonts]{uge} % Use Inria fonts, make sure to have the ttf files in the same directory.
#+END_SRC 


*** Colors
You can inverse the colors of the title page by using the =reversed= option of the theme. By default the background is blue and fonts are in white.
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\usetheme{uge}           % background blue, foreground white
\usetheme[reversed]{uge} % background white, foreground blue
#+END_SRC

*** 16/9 or 4/3 formats
The theme has been tested on either =16:9= or =4:3= formats (by default). 
To get a =16:9= format, you can customize the =aspectratio= option parameter in the document class:
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\documentclass[aspectratio=169]{beamer}
#+END_SRC
