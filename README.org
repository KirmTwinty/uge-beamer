** Introduction
The purpose of this beamer theme is to provide a beamer template for presentation for Universit√© Gustave Eiffel.

** Installation
To use the theme, download the =.sty= files and the =img= folder by the method of your choice (download the archive directly or using =git clone=).

You can also try the theme by compiling the provided =test.tex= file. The file provides details on how to use the theme in comments.

** Usage

*** Colors
You can inverse the colors of the title page by using the =reversed= option of the theme. By default the background is blue and fonts are in white.
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\usetheme{uge}           % background blue, foreground white
\usetheme[reversed]{uge} % background white, foreground blue
#+END_SRC

*** 16/9 or 4/3 formats
The theme has been tested on either =16:9= or =4:3= formats (by default). 
To get a =16:9= format, you can customize the =aspectratio= option parameter in the document class:
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\documentclass[aspectratio=169]{beamer}
#+END_SRC
